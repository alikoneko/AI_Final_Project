To get this to compile (if it is not compiling), you will need to do a few things:
1. Install NuGet. This will give you access to the following needed resources and references:
	a. System.Data.Sqlite
	b. Nlog
   The database is used as repository for type effectiveness and the list of seed pokemon. It will not compile without these.
   https://www.nuget.org/
   To install the packages, just right click on the project -> Manage NuGet Packages -> Search Go.
2. Add the references to the project. 
3. Try Again. 

If all else fails:
Email me, aneer1@fau.edu or ali@alineer.com, and I will send you either a binary or help you compile it. I worked really hard on this. 
Thank you for taking the time to look at it.
